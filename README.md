Gitlauncher by Nasdrovia
==========

Visual Basic file patcher / game launcher.
It includes MD5 files checking, elevation checking, auto-updater, ini manipulation class, download speed and moar !

Features
* Everything can be edited remotly using a text file
* The launcher update itself on startup
* Checks local files using a remote list (See Folder MD5 Generator for the structure)
* Async download (with events on change and completed)
* Delete temp files on closing event
* Probably other stuff I forgot :)

To-do
* Better error handler
* Sub-progress bar ? Like file downloading progress bar and another one displaying the progress of the whole update (2/10 files downloaded = 20%)
* Better way of saving/using user's selected path
